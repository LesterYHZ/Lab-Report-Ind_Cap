\begin{abstract}
	Capacitors and Inductors are essential to the operation of analog filters and power electronics. Capacitors are frequently used to store charge in case of a sudden inrush of current draw, and inductors can be used to filter out high frequency noise in a power cable. This lab include four experiments: \textit{building resistors/ capacitors/inductors}, \textit{current and voltage measurements of inductors}, \textit{current and voltage measurements of capacitors}, and \textit{capacitor voltage divider}

    	\begin{enumerate}
        	\item Estimate the resistance across a piece of pencil lead \footnote{Graphite has a resistivity on the order of $3\cdot
10^{-5}\Omega$ m}
            \item Use LCR to measure the resistance of the piece of pencil lead; compute the error (\textit{see Table 1})
            \item Estimate the capacitance of a capacitor built with two metal plates separated by a single sheet of printer paper
            \item Build the capacitor and use LCR to measure the capacitance; compute the error (\textit{see Table 1})
            \item Estimate the inductance of a 20 turn inductor with a diameter of 5mm
            \item Build the inductor and use an LCR to measure the inductance; compute the error (\textit{see Table 1})
        \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Results}
    	% This is how you define a table: the [!hbt] means that LaTeX is forced (by the !) to place the table exactly here (by h), or if that doesnt work because of a pagebreak or so, it tries to place the table to the bottom of the page (by b) or the top (by t).

			% To create a horizontal line, type \hline

			% To end a column type &

			Resistor & 7.0158$\Omega$ &1.1835 $\Omega$ & 83\%\\

\(\)		Capacitor &60.87nF & 65.4nF & 7.44\%\\

			Inductor & 0.702mH & 0.759mH & 8.1\%\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}
    
    \subsection{Evaluations}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The percent error of the resistance is so large that it can be concluded that the resistivity of the tested pencil lead is not as the data provided. With the equation $R = \rho\frac{L}{A}$ the resistivity can be computed to be $1.59\cdot10^{-5}\Omega m$
%				\item The large percent error of the inductance indicates that the screwdriver in the 207 kits is not purely made of steel which should have a relative permeability of 2000; in the experiment the relative permeability of the material of the screwdriver is computed to be 
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Conclusion}
	% LaTeX takes complete care of your document layout ...
	%The presentation's content is summarized in the report in 4~pages.
	% ... but you can insert a line break manually with two backslashes, if needed: \\
	%The author should fill, but not exceed, this space. \\
	%The report should be a self-contained report, so that it can be understood without studying additional literature.
    			The measured values have a large difference from the computed values. Therefore, the constant of the materials need to be tested for future experiments. Also, some errors on the manipulation may increase errors on the measured values.

    	\item Circuit Design      \begin{figure}[!hbt]

			\end{center}
        \end{figure}
    	\end{itemize}
    \subsection{Procedures}
    	\begin{enumerate}
    	\item Build the test circuit (see \textit{Fig 2}) with $R_{SENSE}=100\Omega$ and the inductor in task 1
        \item Use FG to generate a sine wave with peak-to-peak voltage 20V and frequency 100kHz; measure the voltage across inductor and $R_{SENSE}$
        \item Compute the inductance of the inductor and the error
        \item Repeat using a 1mH inductor with $R_{SENSE}=1K\Omega$
    	\end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Results}
    	\begin{enumerate}
    	\item The voltage across the inductor and the resistor in the case of $R_{SENSE}=100\Omega$
    				\begin{itemize}
    				\item $V_L = 0.06cos(2\pi100000t)$
    				\item $V_R = 13.3sin(2\pi100000t)$
                    \end{itemize}
\item The voltage across the inductor and the resistor in the case of $R_{SENSE} = 1k\Omega$
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item $V_L = 0.0086cos(2\pi100000t)$
\item $V_R = 19.1sin(2\pi100000t)$
		\end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Evaluations}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item To compute the current, based on the equation $V = L\frac{dI}{dt}$ and $I = \frac{V}{R}$ , the current across the resistor is $$I_R = \frac{V_R}{R_{SENSE}} = \frac{13.3sin(2\pi100000t)}{100}$$ and the voltage across the inductor is $$V_L = L\frac{dI_R}{dt} = L\cdot0.133cos(2\pi100000t)2\pi100000$$ and $$V_L = 0.06cos(2\pi100000t)$$ $$0.06 = 0.133L\cdot2\pi100000$$$$L = 0.845mH$$
\item The error is 20.4\%
\item With $R_{SENSE} = 1K\Omega$, $L = 0.718mH$, and the error is 2.3\%

    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Conclusion}
    The test result has a large error compared with the computed value; this may be caused by that the coil for inductor is not winded tightly around the screwdriver and thus there is air between the screwdriver and the coil which would caused to the measured value to be inaccurate.

    \subsection{Evaluations}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item To compute the capacitance, according to the equations $I = C\frac{dV}{dt}$ and $I = \frac{V}{R}$ , $$i_C = \frac{V_R}{R} = \frac{V_R}{1000}$$and $$i_C = C\frac{dV_C}{dt}$$ therefore, $$\frac{V_R}{1000} = V\frac{dV_C}{dt}$$ $$C\cdot0.275\cdot(2\pi100000t)2\pi100000 = \frac{1}{1000}\cdot9.6cos(2\pi100000t)$$thus $$C = 55.6nF$$ The error is 8.66\%
\item With the same procedures of computation, the capacitance in the experiment with one 10nF capacitor is equal to 11.3nF, and the error is 13\%
\item The capacitance in the experiment with two 10nF capacitors in parallel is 18.2nF, and the error is 9\%
\item The capacitance in the experiment with two 10nF capacitors in series is 4.5nF, and the error is 10\%
        \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Conclusion}
	The result capacitance of capacitors in parallel is $C_{result} = C_1 + C_2$. The results capacitance of capacitors in series is $\frac{1}{C_{result}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}$ .

\subsection{Evaluations}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item After $C_1$ and $C_2$ were swapped, the signal plot (\textit{see Fig 6}), compared with the original plot (\textit{see Fig 5}), became more intensive as it can be viewed in the two plots with same time scale. Because the capacitance of $C_2$ is larger than $C_1$, the voltage across $C_1$ in the second plot is smaller than that across $C_2$ in the first plot while the $V_{IN}$ remains the same
\item Changing the frequency of FG does not necessarily affect the attenuation ratio since in this case the only quantity changed is the frequency and thus the voltage ratio remains the same
\item If FG generates DC voltage to the circuit, the circuit does not work like a voltage divider since in a DC circuit, capacitors are like open circuit when fully charged; therefore, the voltage across the capacitor in this experiment is small
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Conclusion}
		Capacitors can be used as voltage dividers in a AC circuit but they would be work in a DC circuit.
